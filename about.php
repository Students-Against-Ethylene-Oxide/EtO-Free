          EtO-free is a cohort of teen girls dedicated to promoting beauty products free from the cancer causing chemical Ethylene Oxide (EtO). We focus on reviewing EtO-free products to open the floodgates of information to motivate girls and women to push for
          transparency in product labeling and production.

        <h3> Alexandra Collins</h3>
        <h4> Founder and Senior Director </h4>
        <p>In 2018, Alexandra discovered that for 30 years, the Sterigenics company located near her neighborhood had been emitting high levels of Ethylene Oxide (EtO). As a result, her community suffered from a cancer rate nearly <em> nine-times </em> the national average. After learning that EtO is commonly used to sterilize beauty products, Alexandra decided to provide consumers with information on product sterilization in beauty and skincare by starting the EtO-free project!

          <h3> Elyssa Chandler </h3>
          <h4> Website Manager </h4>
          <p>
              After learning about EtO from Alexandra in 2020, Elyssa joined the group in the hopes of spreading awareness by creating a website for beauty product consumers to use to learn about the unspoken dangers behind popular brands that use EtO.

        <h4> Video Coordinator </h4>
        <p>
            Since learning about EtO as a freshman in high-school, Emily worried about how EtO was affecting her friends and familyâ€™s health. Because of this, she decided to help educate people unaware of this problem while also learning more about this topic herself
            by joining SAEtO.

        <h3> Hunter Malinowski</h3>
        <h4> App Manager </h4>
        <p>
            Hunter first heard about Ethylene Oxide from Alexandra. Shocked to find out how it had affected Alexandra and her community, she wanted to do everything she could to help out. Based off her own lack of knowledge, she knew that the dangers of EtO were
            not on most people's radars which made her decide to help raise awareness about the negative effects of EtO in beauty and skincare products.

        <h4> Research Manager </h4>
        <p>
          Amirah first did some research on EtO in 2019, having heard of the subject but never having understood it. After learning that the cancer-causing chemical had been emitted in large quantities in her community, she realized the harmful risks of EtO, becoming
          more aware of the toxic chemical. This drove her to join SAEtO and help raise awareness for the dangerous effects it could have on people and their loved ones.

          In 2019, Eliana learned about the ongoing EtO issue in her community. After doing more research on the subject, she found that there was a Sterigenics plant near her neighborhood. From there, she concerned herself more with the issue, signing petitions
          among other things in an attempt to do her part in solving the EtO problem while learning more about it.
